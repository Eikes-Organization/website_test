<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="include"><code>include</code></h2>
<p>If you have content you want to include across many files, you can place that content in a separate Quarto file and use the <code>include</code> comment wherever you want to pull it in.</p>
<p>This could be useful for plain text content (e.g., including the same submission instructions for each homework assignment) or for content that includes computation (e.g., including the same data cleaning steps for various alternate analyses).</p>
<p>Suppose you have such repeatable content in a file called <code>_content-to-repeat.qmd</code> and suppose the contents of that file read <em>Look at me, I’m content to be repeated!</em> (in italics):</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-simple callout-note no-icon callout-titled" title="hello">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon no-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
hello
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p><strong>content-to-repeat.qmd</strong></p>
<pre><code>*Look at me, I'm content to be repeated!*</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>You can include it in other documents using the <code>{{&lt; include &gt;}}</code> shortcode:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode markdown code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb2-1">{{&lt; include _content-to-repeat.qmd &gt;}}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will result in:</p>
<p><em>Look at me I’m content to be repeated!</em></p>
<p>A few important things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the file that will be included should start with an underscore (<code>_</code>) so that they are automatically ignored (i.e.&nbsp;not treated as standalone files) when rendering a project.</li>
<li>All computations within a document will share a single engine (e.g., knitr and jupyter), which is relevant when the included file has computations.</li>
<li>The included file does not have to be a <code>.qmd</code> if it only contains text, it can also be a <code>.md</code>, <code>.ipynb</code>, etc. However included files with computation in them need to be <code>.qmd</code>, computational includes don’t work in <code>.ipynb</code> notebook files.</li>
</ul>

<section id="freeze-auto-true" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="freeze-auto-true"><code>freeze: auto / true</code></h2>
<p>For Quarto projects with many documents that include code, you probably won’t want to re-execute all of that code each time you render the project. The <code>freeze</code> execution option is helpful for managing that.</p>
<p>For example, you might have a Quarto blog and when you render the website you wouldn’t want code from old blog posts to be re-rendered automatically, you would likely prefer to leave them as is as of the date they were published. Or you might be using Quarto for a course website and have slides, homework assignments, etc. in that website that you add as the semester progresses. You wouldn’t want to re-render all of those old documents each time you add new items to your website.</p>
<p>Managing execution for these purposes is straightforward with Quarto using the <code>freeze</code> option in your <code>_quarto.yml</code> file for your project, e.g.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">execute</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">:</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">  </span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">freeze</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;
background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;"> </span><span class="ch" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">true</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can set this option to <code>true</code> or <code>auto</code>. By default, it’s <code>false</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>freeze: true</code> - Never re-render during project render. If you need the page/document to be re-rendered, you need to render that document individually.
<ul>
<li>This is the option I use for blogs as I want to make sure to avoid re-rendering old posts unless I explicitly do so.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>freeze: auto</code> - Re-render only when source changes.
<ul>
<li>This is the option I use for my course websites – when I catch a mistake in earlier slide decks, and update the source code, I want those documents re-render next time I render my project, I don’t want to rely on remembering to re-render them myself.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <code>freeze</code> controls whether execution occurs during global project renders. If you do render a single document or a sub-directory in a Quarto project, then the code is always executed.</p>
